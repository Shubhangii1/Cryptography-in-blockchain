This code implements the RSA encryption scheme for generating public and private keys, signing a message, and verifying the signature using cryptography library. The code defines three functions - generate_keys(), sign(), and verify().

The generate_keys() function generates an RSA private key with a public exponent of 65537 and key size of 2048 bits. It then returns the private and corresponding public key.

The sign() function takes in a message and the private key as input. It converts the message to bytes using UTF-8 encoding and generates a signature using PSS padding scheme with SHA256 as the hash function.

The verify() function takes in a message, the signature, and the public key as input. It converts the message to bytes using UTF-8 encoding and verifies the signature using PSS padding scheme with SHA256 as the hash function. If the signature is valid, it returns True, else it returns False.

In the main block, the generate_keys() function is called to generate a private and public key pair. The message "Hello I'm shubhangiii" is signed using the private key using the sign() function. The signature is then verified using the verify() function with the public key. If the signature is valid, "successful" is printed, else "failed" is printed.

Overall, the code provides a secure way of generating RSA keys and signing messages with the private key and verifying the signature with the corresponding public key.
